  - The first steps of the project have begun. We have decided to create a 2D pixel art game with a top-down perspective and a story-driven approach.
  - I have used a graphics tablet for the first time in my life and have drawn an initial character concept, in both plain 2D and pixel art. The three stages represent the evolution we plan to implement in the game.

- 🧱 **Tile Map Investigation**
  - Researched how to generate tile maps in Unity.
  - Compared tile sizes (16px vs 32px).
  - **Decision:** Using 32px tiles for more details.

- ⏰ **Time Mechanic**
  - Implemented in-game time system.
  - 1 in-game day = 20 real-life minutes (configurable).

- 🌞🌙 **Day/Night Animation**
  - Drew and implemented an animation that displays a sun or moon based on the in-game time.

- 👻 **Creepiness Mechanic**
  - Implemented a "creepiness" level that updates every night at 03:00 in game time.
