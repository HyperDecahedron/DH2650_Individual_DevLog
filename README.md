  The first steps into the project have begun. We have decided to create a 2D pixel art game, top-down and story based. 
  I have used a graphic tablet for the first time in my life and have drawn an initial idea for a character, both plain 2D and pixel art. The three stages represent the evolution we are planning to implement in the game.
